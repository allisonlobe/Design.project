                        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
                        In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.
                        In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and brown sugar together until creamy.
                        Add the egg, molasses, and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.
                        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix until combined. The dough will be thick.
                        Divide the dough in half and wrap each portion in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up the dough.
                        Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about ¼-inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes, and place them on the prepared baking sheets.
                        Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are firm but not browned. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
                        Optional: Decorate with icing, candies, or sprinkles.

                        Melt the semisweet chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between until smooth. Pour the melted chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly.
                        Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to chill and set for about 10-15 minutes.
                        While the semisweet chocolate layer is setting, melt the white chocolate chips in the same way, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth.
                        Remove the baking sheet from the fridge and pour the melted white chocolate over the set semisweet chocolate layer. Use a spatula to spread evenly.
                        Sprinkle the crushed peppermint candies on top and lightly press them into the chocolate.
                        Return to the fridge for 20-30 minutes or until fully set. Once firm, break into pieces and serve.
